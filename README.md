# **REST API Template: Actix & MongoDB**

This is a template for building a robust and secure REST API using **Actix** and **MongoDB**. It provides a solid, ready-to-use foundation with user authentication built-in, designed to help you get your project started quickly.

## **Key Features**

* **User Authentication**: Includes ready-to-use endpoints for user registration (`/register`) and login (`/login`).
* **Secure Routing**: A middleware controls access to protected routes, leveraging **Bearer Authentication** with **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.
* **Database Integration**: Utilizes **MongoDB** for efficient and flexible data persistence.
* **API Documentation**: Automatically generates **OpenAPI** (Swagger) definitions using **Utoipa**, making it easy to understand and interact with the API's structure.

## **Future Enhancements**

This project is planned to evolve into a full-stack template. Upcoming features will include a frontend built with **Leptos** for compilation to **WebAssembly (WASM)**, as well as wrappers to support cross-platform web and mobile applications from a single codebase.
